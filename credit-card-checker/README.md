# Credit Card Checker Project
### Codecademy Project<br>
*Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!*

## JavaScript Usage:
- Loops
- Arrays
- Objects
- Iterators

## Details:
- validateCred() checks if the array is a valid credit card number using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)<br>
**Note:** American Express has less digits than Visa or Mastercard
- findInvalidCards() checks the nested array of card #s and returns a nested array of invalid cards
- idInvalidCardCompanies() returns an array of companies that have mailed out cards with invalid numbers. It will not contain duplicates
